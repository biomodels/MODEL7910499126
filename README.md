# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Alternans and spiral breakup in a human ventricular tissue model.**   
ten Tusscher KH, Panfilov AV. _Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol._ (2006)

**Abstract:**   
Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is one of the main causes of death in the
Western world. According to one hypothesis, the chaotic excitation dynamics
during VF are the result of dynamical instabilities in action potential
duration (APD) the occurrence of which requires that the slope of the APD
restitution curve exceeds 1. Other factors such as electrotonic coupling and
cardiac memory also determine whether these instabilities can develop. In this
paper we study the conditions for alternans and spiral breakup in human
cardiac tissue. Therefore, we develop a new version of our human ventricular
cell model, which is based on recent experimental measurements of human APD
restitution and includes a more extensive description of intracellular calcium
dynamics. We apply this model to study the conditions for electrical
instability in single cells, for reentrant waves in a ring of cells, and for
reentry in two-dimensional sheets of ventricular tissue. We show that an
important determinant for the onset of instability is the recovery dynamics of
the fast sodium current. Slower sodium current recovery leads to longer
periods of spiral wave rotation and more gradual conduction velocity
restitution, both of which suppress restitution-mediated instability. As a
result, maximum restitution slopes considerably exceeding 1 (up to 1.5) may be
necessary for electrical instability to occur. Although slopes necessary for
the onset of instabilities found in our study exceed 1, they are within the
range of experimentally measured slopes. Therefore, we conclude that steep APD
restitution-mediated instability is a potential mechanism for VF in the human
heart.
